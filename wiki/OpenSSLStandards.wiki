I plan to keep this page up to date with OpenSSL standers for interoperability.

== Padding ==
OpenSSL pads its AES 16 Byte blocks, with a value equal to the number of padded bytes.

For example, the following unencrypted 16 Byte block

|| ff || ff || ff || ff ||
|| ff || ff || ff || 03 ||
|| ff || ff || ff || 03 ||
|| ff || ff || ff || 03 ||

has a final byte value of 0x03, which means that the 3 last bytes are padding and should be removed. This rule also means that when presented with a final block of exactly 16 bytes, one would need to add a block filled with the byte value of 16 or 0x10. 

Example

|| ee || aa || bb || aa ||
|| ff || bb || aa || bb ||
|| aa || cc || cc || cc ||
|| bb || dd || dd || dd ||

|| 10 || 10 || 10 || 10 ||
|| 10 || 10 || 10 || 10 ||
|| 10 || 10 || 10 || 10 ||
|| 10 || 10 || 10 || 10 ||
